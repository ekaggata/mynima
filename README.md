# mynima

Mynima is a fork of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) - the default Jekyll theme. Minima is meant to be *a one-size-fits-all Jekyll theme for writers* and I indeed like it a lot albeit I hardly am too much of a writer - and that's why I've came up with the idea to modify it removing what doesn't suit my taste (e.g. the site title appearing 3 times on the same page), making it more microblog-friendly (I prefer to write short (but not short enough to always fit in the limits set by Twitter), want the majority of my posts to appear on the same page and hate inventing titles for every thought I am going to share) and adding some extra features later.
